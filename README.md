## Installation
  One  simply goes to Heroku to open the application, although if one wants to do this locally, they would want to make sure to copy the code, downloading node, and express specifically to allow it to run.

## Usage
  Examples of use would be primarly whenever you do not have a piece of paper and a pen or pencil, you can create a note easily with this application, and when you no longer need the reminder, deleting it is as easy as a button press

## Contributing
  Base source code was retrieved from Xander Rapstine (Xandromus) and John McCambridge (nol166) on GitHub.

## Testing
